# Wachspress2D3D

## 1) Quickstart

The purpose of this code is to define interpolant and l projector on 1D - 2D and 3D convex polytopes.
Start by running *run_me2.mlx*, or if it doesn't work because of compatibility issues, *run_me.m*.
For Matlab versions earlier than R2020B, you have to install MMX on your system :

## 2) Structure

* **run_me.m** and **run_me2.mlx** are examples files.
* **Domain.m** is a class file which includes the definition of polytopes, the projection and the display methods.
* **wachspress.m** is a function which returns the values of the Wachspress basis functions and their gradient a given points and a given domain. The points should be inside the domain.
* **t.m** and **mult.m** are multithread transpose and matrix multiplication operators to speed up the calculation in case there are lots of points.
